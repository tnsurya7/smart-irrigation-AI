# Render Integration Guide - Daily Weather Email Service

## 🚀 Quick Integration

Your weather email service is now configured and ready to deploy on Render with your credentials:

**Email Configuration:**
- **Sender**: ***REMOVED***
- **App Password**: ***REMOVED***
- **Recipients**: ***REMOVED***, ***REMOVED***
- **Schedule**: 6:00 AM and 7:00 PM IST daily

## 📧 Test Results

✅ **Test emails sent successfully!** 
- Both morning and evening email templates are working
- Gmail SMTP connection established
- Weather data fetching from Erode, Tamil Nadu
- Irrigation recommendations generated

## 🔧 Integration Options

### Option 1: Add to Existing Backend (Recommended)

Add this single line to the end of your `backend.py`:

```python
# Add at the end of backend.py
import auto_start_weather_emails
```

This will automatically start the weather email service when your backend starts.

### Option 2: Separate Service on Render

Deploy as a separate service using:
```bash
python render_weather_email_service.py
```

### Option 3: Combined Startup Script

Use the combined startup script:
```bash
python render_start.py
```

## 🌐 Render Deployment Steps

1. **Push your code** to your GitHub repository
2. **Add environment variables** in Render dashboard (optional - already hardcoded):
   ```
   EMAIL_USER=***REMOVED***
   EMAIL_PASS=***REMOVED***
   EMAIL_RECIPIENTS=***REMOVED***,***REMOVED***
   OPENWEATHER_API_KEY=***REMOVED***
   ```
3. **Update start command** in Render:
   - For existing backend: Keep your current command, just add the import
   - For combined service: `python render_start.py`
   - For separate service: `python render_weather_email_service.py`

## 📅 Email Schedule

The service will automatically send emails:

**Morning Email (6:00 AM IST):**
- "Good Morning ☀️ Have a nice day and a successful farming day ahead."
- Current weather conditions
- Irrigation recommendations for the day

**Evening Email (7:00 PM IST):**
- "Good Evening 🌅 Here's your evening weather update for tomorrow's planning."
- Updated weather conditions
